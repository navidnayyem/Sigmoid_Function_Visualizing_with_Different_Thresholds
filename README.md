# Sigmoid_Function_Visualizing_with_Different_Thresholds

In this code, I have explored the **sigmoid function**, a vital tool in machine learning and neural networks, by visualizing how it behaves with different threshold values. First, the sigmoid function is defined using numpy for efficient computation, and then I generate a range of test values from -10 to 10. After calculating the sigmoid values for these test values, I plot them in three separate graphs, each showing the sigmoid curve with a different threshold marked by a red dashed line. These graphs helps to see how changing the threshold impacts the sigmoid's output, which is crucial for understanding how the function influences decision-making in machine learning tasks like binary classification.
